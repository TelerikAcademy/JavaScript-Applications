## Application description

The application must provide the following functionality

			* A fortune cookie, shared by other user
	* **Like** or **dislike** a fortune cookie
	* **Get** their hourly fortune cookie
		* A random cookie from all shared cookies
		* This cookie is changed every hour
			* i.e. if the user asks for their fortune cookie at 11:30 and then again at 11:45, their fortune cookie will be the same
			* or if the user asks for their fortune cookie at 11:30 and then again at 12:00, the two fortune cookies may be different
				* It depends on the total count of fortune cookies
* **All users** (even not logged in) can **see** fortune cookies, that are shared by any user
