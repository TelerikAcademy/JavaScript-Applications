Create a function that:
*   Takes an array of students
    *   Each student has a `firstName` and `lastName` properties
*   **Finds** all students whose `firstName` is before their `lastName` alphabetically
*   Then **sorts** them in descending order by fullname
    *   fullname is the concatenation of `firstName`, ' ' (empty space) and `lastName`
*   Then **prints** the fullname of founded students to the console
*   **Use underscore.js for all operations**
