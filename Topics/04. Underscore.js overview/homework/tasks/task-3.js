/* 
Create a function that:
*   Takes an array of students
    *   Each student has:
        *   `firstName`, `lastName`, `age` and `marks` properties
        *   `marks` is an array of decimal numbers representing the marks         
*   **finds** the student with highest average mark (there will be only one)
*   **prints** to the console  'FOUND_STUDENT_FULLNAME has an average score of MARK_OF_THE_STUDENT'
    *   fullname is the concatenation of `firstName`, ' ' (empty space) and `lastName`
*   **Use underscore.js for all operations**
